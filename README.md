const Background = styled.section`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`;

const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: ${(props) => props.color};
`;

@Component({
  tag: 'my-component'
})
export class MyComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <Background>
        <Title color="palevioletred">Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>
      </Background>
